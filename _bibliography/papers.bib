  abstract    = {Neural networks have been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial examples; these are examples that can be recognized by both humans and neural networks, although neural networks give incorrect predictions. As an intriguing property of neural networks, adversarial examples pose a serious threat to the secure application of neural networks. In this article, we present another intriguing property of neural networks: the fact that well-trained models believe some examples to be recognizable objects (often with high confidence), while humans cannot recognize such examples. We refer to these as “fooling examples”. Specifically, we take inspiration from the construction of adversarial examples and develop an iterative method for generating fooling examples. The experimental results show that fooling examples can not only be easily generated, with a success rate of nearly 100\% in the white-box scenario, but also exhibit strong transferability across different models in the black-box scenario. Tests on the Google Cloud Vision API show that fooling examples can also be recognized by real-world computer vision systems. Our findings reveal a new cognitive deficit of neural networks, and we hope that these potential security threats will be addressed in future neural network applications.},

  abstract     = {It is demonstrated that deep neural networks can be easily fooled by adversarial examples. To improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks, substantial research on adversarial defenses is being carried out, of which input transformation is a typical category of defenses. However, because the transformation also has an impact on the accuracy of clean examples, the existing transformation-based defenses usually adopt minor transformations such as shift and scaling, which limits the defense effect of the transformation to some extent. To this end, we propose a method by using dynamic and diverse transformations for defending against adversarial attacks. Firstly, we constructed a transformation pool that contains both minor and major transformations (e.g., flip, rotate). Secondly, we retrained the model with the data transformed by major transformations to ensure that the performance of model itself is not affected. Finally, we dynamically select transformations to preprocess the input of the model to defend against adversarial examples. We conducted extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and compared our method with the state-of-the-art adversarial training and transformation-based defenses. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods, improving the robustness of the model against adversarial examples greatly while maintaining high accuracy on clean examples.

However, Machine learning models are demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which pose serious threats in security-critical applications. This paper summarizes the adversarial attacks and defenses from a practical perspective, facing the field of image classification. We further analyze and evaluate the characteristics and performance of various defense techniques from four aspects: gradient masking, adversarial training, adversarial examples detection and input transformations. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different defenses. Finally, the future development trend of defense techniques against adversarial examples is discussed. We hope our study will advance the research in machine learning security.},
